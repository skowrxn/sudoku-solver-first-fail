    An abstract class defining a sudoku solver.
    Every sudoku solver is supposed to inherit from this class
    and implement the `run_algorithm` method.

    Protected Attributes:
    ---------------------
    _puzzle: SudokuGrid
        **copy** of the sudoku puzzle to be solved. Solvers can modify this grid.
    _time_limit: float
        how much time is available for the solver
    _deadline: float
        a deadline used in the built-in _timeout() method

    Methods:
    --------
    _timeout() -> bool:
        checks whether the available time has run out

    Abstract Methods:
    -----------------
    run_algorithm(self) -> SudokuGrid | None:
        implements the specific solving algorithm

    Class Methods:

    solve(cls, puzzle: SudokuGrid, time_limit: float, *args, **kwargs) -> SudokuGrid | None:
        an interface method supposed dispatch correct algorithm
